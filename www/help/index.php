<h1><u>DigiPi Plus</u></h1>

<div>
    <p>DigiPi Plus is intended to be a suppliment to the DigiPi image created by <a href="digipi.org">Craig KM6LYW</a>, with the goal being to add more functionality to the original project.
    The idea is to be minimally intrusive to the original system, yet provide a user friendly experience with minimal configuration effort.
    Please enjoy the additions, and feel free to reach out with any comments, bugs, and/or suggestions.</p>
