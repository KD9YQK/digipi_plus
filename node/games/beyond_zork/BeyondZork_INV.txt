Grubbo-by-the-Sea
*****************

Why can't I talk to the old sailor?
  A. Perhaps he's a bit hard of hearing.
  B. YELL AT THE SAILOR.
  C. Oh, well. You don't need to talk to him anyway.

What's the significance of the sailor's painting?
  A. You'll find out, if you live long enough.

How do I get the driftwood out of the water?
  A. Easy. Just GET THE DRIFTWOOD OUT OF THE WATER.

What's a shillelagh?
  A. EXAMINE THE SHILLELAGH.
  B. "Shillelagh" is an Irish word for a cudgel.
  C. A cudgel is a club for bashing things.

A leprechaun stole my shillelagh! How do I get it back?
  A. EXAMINE THE RAINBOW. It may hold a clue to the thief's whereabouts.
  B. LOOK UNDER THE POT OF GOLD.
  C. Rainbow? Pot of gold?
  D. Remember the warning in the introduction! Don't let the presence or
     absence of questions influence your play, and don't assume that long
     answers are associated with important questions.

What's the significance of the sign outside the tavern?
  A. Read the room description again, carefully.
  B. Part of the sign is made of a real lantern.
  C. TAKE THE LANTERN OFF THE HOOK. You'll be glad you did.

How do I get into the tavern?
  A. Just GO INTO THE TAVERN. (Make sure you OPEN THE FRONT DOOR first.)

One of the bandits threw a dagger at me! What should I do?
  A. Relax. They're just amusing themselves.
  B. Besides, there may be something in it for you.
  C. PULL THE DAGGER OUT OF THE WALL. It might come in handy later.

     though.
  B. ASK THE COOK ABOUT THE GIANT ONION.

     you can ROLL THE ONION in any direction you like.

  A. There's a door leading downward.
  B. OPEN THE CELLAR DOOR. GO DOWN THE STAIRS.


The Wine Cellar
***************

The Lore and Legends of Quendor doesn't say anything about rat-ants!
  A. Take heart. The Rat-Ant's Cookbook says plenty about peasants.
  B. Rat-ants, though small, can be quite deadly. Fight back!

What do I do with the crinkly scroll?
  A. READ THE SCROLL. It may give you a clue.
  B. If strange, flowing runes are inscribed across the top of the scroll,
     skip ahead to the next question.
  C. The strange word on the scroll is its Word of Power.
  D. To invoke a scroll's Magick, you must speak its Word of Power. For
     example, if the scroll's word is "Foo," type SAY "FOO" or just FOO.

I can't read the runes on a scroll! What's going on?
  A. Your character's intelligence isn't high enough to read this scroll.
     You must either find a way to improve your character's intelligence, or
     RESTART the story with a smarter character.

I spoke the Word on the crinkly scroll. What happened?
  A. The "refreshing pink aura" that surrounded you when you spoke the Word
     also surrounded your possessions.
  B. EXAMINE the items you were holding when you read the scroll.
  C. The crinkly scroll is a Scroll of Refreshment. If you're holding the
     rusty lantern when you read this scroll, the lantern now "looks good as
     new," and you'll find that it lasts much longer. The rusty dagger is
     also renewed and sharpened by the scroll.
  D. Other items can be affected by the Scroll of Refreshment. Experiment!

My scroll disappeared! How do I get it back?
  A. You don't. Ever. So forget it.

How do I see in the dark?
  A. You need a source of light.
  B. Remember the name of the tavern upstairs?
  C. Remember that sign outside the tavern?
  D. Remember the rusty lantern hanging on that sign outside the tavern?
  E. You'll need that lantern to survive in the wine cellar. Next time,
     remember to read room descriptions carefully, and try to TAKE
     everything that isn't nailed down.

I just found a wand (stick, rod, stave, cane or staff)! How do I use it?
  A. Just point it at the thing you want to affect.

How do I get the tiny crown from the discipline crab?
  A. He's not likely to give it up without a fight.
  B. ATTACK THE DISCIPLINE CRAB
  C. If you win, he'll drop the crown.

Can I do anything with the pile of seashells?
  A. SEARCH THE PILE. There may be something interesting within.

Why can't I climb the stack of crates?
  A. Not very coordinated, are you?
  B. Coordination is related to dexterity.
  C. Your character's dexterity isn't high enough to climb the stack. You
     must either find a way to improve your character's dexterity, or
     RESTART the story with a more dexterous character.
  D. Something in the cellar can help you increase your dexterity.
  E. Read The Lore and Legends of Quendor.
  F. One of the rooms in the wine cellar has moss on the walls.
  G. The "Moss of Mareilon" entry in Lore and Legends explains how you can
     use the moss to improve your dexterity.
  H. Be patient. It takes a few moves for the moss to take effect.

My lantern keeps going out. Where can I recharge it?
  A. Bring it to the nearest hardware store. (Too bad there aren't any
     hardware stores in this part of Quendor.)
  B. The crinkly scroll can serve the same purpose, though.
  C. Refer to the questions about the crinkly scroll for more clues.

Help! A skeleton is strangling me!
  A. The slightest defense is enough to defeat the skeleton.
  B. KICK THE SKELETON. Preferably before he kills you.

How do I decipher the runes on the amulet?
  A. Something about the runes makes them different from the swirls and
     flourishes.
  B. It's their color.
  C. Magick can't help you here, but perhaps Science can.
  D. Specifically, the Science of Optics.
  E. A color filter might help you distinguish the green runes from the red
     swirls and flourishes.
  F. Something in the cellar can be used as a red color filter.
  G. It's the bottle of wine.
  H. LOOK AT THE AMULET THROUGH THE WINE BOTTLE. The red, transparent liquid
     will mask out the red swirls enough for you to read the green runes.

Of what use is the amulet?
  A. It makes a nice necklace. PUT ON THE AMULET.
  B. While wearing the amulet, speak the Word of Power inscribed upon it.
     (See the previous question on how to read the amulet.)
  C. For even more fun, type STATUS before you speak the amulet's Word.
  D. Be warned! The extra strength lasts only a few moves. Also, you can
     only invoke the amulet's Magick three times.

How do I get back upstairs out of the cellar?
  A. If you had a key, maybe you could unlock the door. Unfortunately, there
     are no keys to be found. Looks as if you'll have to break the door
     down.
  B. You'd have to be pretty strong to break down that door.
  C. It's unlikely that any character you would create would be strong
     enough to do the job.
  D. Luckily, there's something magical in the wine cellar that can help.
  E. PUT ON THE AMULET and speak the Word of Power inscribed upon it. (See
     previous two questions.)
  F. This should boost your strength enough to BREAK DOWN THE CELLAR DOOR.
     (If your character's strength isn't high enough, you must either find a
     way to improve it, or RESTART the story with a stronger character.)
  G. There are three other magical ways out of the cellar, but you might not
     yet have the magic items needed.
  H. The Wand of Sayonara will also get you out. You want to teleport
     yourself, so POINT THE WAND OF SAYONARA AT MYSELF.
  I. The scroll of Recall will transport you out, but only if you've said
     its Word of Power elsewhere. Speaking the Word of Power a second time
     will return you to where it was first spoken.
  J. The scroll of Gating (the palimpsest) will also save you. Just hold the
     palimpsest and speak its Word of Power.

I saved my game just before I entered the wine cellar. When I restored and
went down again, the geography was different! What's going on?
  A. The wine cellar is one of several "regions" in the story which are
     randomly generated the first time you enter them. The geography isn't
     the only thing that varies; the names of magic items and the locations
     of treasures and monsters may also differ. Once you enter a region, its
     attributes remain constant for the remainder of the story.


The Lighthouse
**************

What's the meaning of the inscription on the cliff wall?
  A. It's a riddle.
  B. A dictionary might help you find the answer.

     meanings.
  D. Don't develop the next hint unless you're really stumped.
  E. Type the word LIGHTNING and watch what happens.

That giant slug is tough! Anything I can do to improve my odds?
  A. You don't need to defeat the slug to complete the story.
  B. Bloodthirsty, eh? Well, if fighting, Magick or running away don't work,
     there is an alternative.
  C. Chemical warfare.
  D. Slugs are notoriously sensitive to a certain common substance.
  E. That substance is salt.
  F. There's a patch of brine at the Tidal Flats near the lighthouse.
  G. Go to the Tidal Flats and GET SOME SALT. Then return to the lighthouse
     and HURL THE SALT AT THE GIANT SLUG.

How do I get the dust bunny?
  A. Just PICK UP THE DUST BUNNY.
  B. Prolific, aren't they?
  C. You can't take any of the dust bunnies. But you'll have to get rid of
     them to complete the story.

These dust bunnies are driving me nuts! What do I do?
  A. Read The Lore and Legends of Quendor.
  B. There are no lemon-scented sprays to be found in this story.
  C. There is an excellent source of static electricity, though.
  D. It's in the tavern.
  E. It's the bearskin rug lying on the floor.
  F. See what happens when you WALK ACROSS THE BEARSKIN RUG.
  G. Try touching something after you walk across the rug.
  H. Bring the rug to the room with dust bunnies. PUT DOWN THE RUG THEN WALK
     ACROSS IT. TOUCH A DUST BUNNY.
  I. Don't forget to PICK UP THE RING. You'll need it later.

Is there any way to get rid of the dornbeast?
  A. You can fight the dornbeast, but you're not likely to survive. Only the
     most powerful Magick can destroy him. That dorn is tough ... but not
     invulnerable.
  B. Read The Lore and Legends of Quendor.
  C. Have you studied the illustration of the dornbeast?
  D. The dornbeast has 69 sensitive eyes.
  E. There's an object in the game which can wreak havoc on sensitive eyes.
  F. It's in the tavern.
  G. It's the giant onion in the kitchen.
  H. Roll the giant onion into the Lamphouse. CUT THE GIANT ONION WITH THE
     DAGGER (or any other sharp weapon). This will inconvenience the
     dornbeast long enough for you to GET THE SEA CHEST and scram! (Refer to
     a previous question if you can't take the giant onion.)
  I. You don't need to kill the dornbeast, but if you want to get maximum
     experience in the story (for more endurance) you can repeatedly cut the
     onion and attack the dornbeast while he's disabled by the onion.
     Alternately, POINT THE WAND (or whatever) OF ANNIHILATION AT THE
     DORNBEAST.

Is there anything in the debris besides the chest?
  A. SEARCH THE DEBRIS.
  B. The sextant you find is a valuable treasure.

How do I open the sea chest?
  A. Easy. Just OPEN THE CHEST.
  B. Relax. Pay attention to everything the stallion tells you.
  C. And don't open that chest again!

What on earth can I do with a vague outline?
  A. Nothing... on earth.
  B. The old woman at the Magick Shoppe may be able to tell you.
  C. Have you brought the outline to another plane of existence?

  E. Have you discovered the palimpsest's Word of Power?
  F. While holding the vague outline, speak the Word of Power inscribed upon
     the palimpsest.
  G. Check your inventory. The outline has changed.

What is a palimpsest?
  A. A palimpsest is a writing surface (in this case, a scroll) which has
     been erased and reused.
  B. The palimpsest is the only scroll in the story which can be reused.

  D. WALK THROUGH THE CURTAIN. Convenient, eh?

Is there anything I can do with the Implementors?

  B. Follow orders.
  C. Rejoice in your good fortune! Few indeed are those lucky enough to
     witness an Implementors' Lunch.


Accardi-by-the-Sea
******************

Why aren't there any price tags in the weapon shop?
  A. This is a very exclusive establishment. Its patrons would probably be
     offended by such crass commercialism.

Which weapon should I buy?
  A. The best you can afford.

  C. Don't forget to ask the old woman about the scabbard.

I only have one zorkmid! Where can I find more?

     been picking up might be worth something.
  B. If you think an item may be valuable, SHOW IT TO THE OLD WOMAN to find
     out how much it's worth. You can then SELL THE ITEM to beef up your
     supply of zorkmids.
  C. You can also TRADE items you have for items in the display case.

How do I get into the Guild Hall?
  A. That warning nymph sure is a pest, eh?
  B. You can't get past the warning nymph without help.
  C. Stick around for a few moves. Help is on the way.
  D. The monkey grinder will squash the nymph for you soon after he appears.
     Nothing can stop you now (except the monkey grinder).
  E. You can fight the monkey grinder, but survival is unlikely. Wands and
     scrolls aren't much good against him, either.
  F. Read The Lore and Legends of Quendor.
  G. Did you notice the statistic regarding the literacy rate of monkey
     grinders?
  H. There is an object in the story that could be dangerous to someone who
     can't read.
  I. It's in the lighthouse.
  J. Have you noticed the warning plaque on the sea chest?
  K. GIVE THE SEA CHEST TO THE MONKEY GRINDER after he squashes the warning

The Moors
*********

Help! An eldritch vapor is stealing my possessions!
  A. The vapor won't steal anything that you wield or wear.
  B. Whack it a few times with a good weapon. It'll go away.
  C. Once you've gotten rid of the vapor, look around. You'll find your
     stolen possessions in the moors, scattered but intact.

The pterodactyl won't let me near. Should I ignore him?
  A. Not if you want to finish the story.
  B. If you could heal the pterodactyl's wound, maybe he would trust you.
  C. The Lore and Legends of Quendor mentions a cure for wounds.
  D. You'll find what you need near the Hilltop where the story began.
  E. PICK A WEED from the patch around the billboard at Edge of Storms. You
     can use it to heal the pterodactyl.

How do I treat the pterodactyl? He still won't let me near!
  A. Extracting the arrow is likely to be painful.
  B. You must put the pterodactyl to sleep before you can treat him. There
     are two ways to do this, both involving Magick.
  C. One way is to obtain a Wand of Anesthesia. This can be tricky, as the
     wand's location varies from game to game. If you find the wand, POINT
     IT AT THE PTERODACTYL for immediate results.
  D. The other method involves the hurdy-gurdy.
  E. One of the dial settings on the hurdy-gurdy produces an especially
     relaxing effect.
  F. Bring the hurdy-gurdy to the pterodactyl's room. POINT THE DIAL AT THE
     PICTURE OF AN EAR. CLOSE THE HURDY-GURDY. TURN THE CRANK TO THE RIGHT.
     The soothing music will lull the pterodactyl to sleep. GET THE ARROW
     (yuck). Now RUB THE WEED AGAINST THE WOUND. When the pterodactyl wakes
     up, you'll have a valuable new friend.

Why should I want a pterodactyl for a friend?
  A. He can do something you can't do.
  B. He can fly.
  C. GET ON THE PTERODACTYL. After you've cured him, of course.
  D. His skinny back obviously wasn't meant for riders.
  E. There's a device for supporting riders of skinny backs.
  F. You'll find one in Mizniaport, southwest of the moors.
  G. It's inside the stall.
  H. Once you've figured out how to get the saddle, bring it to the
     pterodactyl and put it on him. RIDE THE PTERODACTYL. Now you can soar
     all over the place by saying FLY (or giving him directions)!

The pterodactyl disappeared! Where did he go?
  A. He flew off when you left him alone.
  B. You can call him back with the whistle. I hope you took it with you.

Is the whistle useful?
  A. Definitely. Try blowing the whistle anywhere outdoors.
  B. Try blowing it when the pterodactyl isn't nearby.
  C. You can use the whistle to summon the pterodactyl up to three times. He
     won't appear if you're near a monster, or anyplace where it would be
     difficult or dangerous for him to land.

The winds make navigation a real pain. Is there anything I can do?
  A. It would be nice if you knew which way the wind was blowing.
  B. It would be even nicer if you could control the wind.
  C. Read The Lore and Legends of Quendor.
  D. Have you found a compass rose yet?

     Fields of Frotzen section of the booklet for clues.
  F. If you EXAMINE THE ROSE, you can see which way the wind is blowing
     from.
  G. To change the wind direction, POINT THE STEM TO THE SOUTH (or towards
     whichever way you want the wind to blow from). Now you can fly
     anywhere.


The Castle
**********

What's the Magick password that will lower the drawbridge?
  A. Ask the pelican.
  B. Insist.
  C. CUT OFF THE PELICAN'S HEAD. That'll teach him to listen!
  D. Password? Drawbridge? Pelican? This isn't Wishbringer.

Help! I keep getting caught by the Queen!
  A. She's likely to catch anybody she sees.
  B. If she couldn't see you, she might not catch you.
  C. Find a place to hide.
  D. HIDE BEHIND THE BUSH and keep quiet! She'll go away eventually.

Is the morgia bush good for anything?
  A. You can hide in it. Ouch! (See previous question.)
  B. Read The Lore and Legends of Quendor.

  B. One item has an unusual description.
  C. EXAMINE THE CLOAK.

     in Gurth City. ASK THE OLD WOMAN ABOUT THE CLOAK.

Do I need the horseshoe?
  A. Yes.
  B. PICK UP THE HORSESHOE. It'll come in handy later.

How do I shoe the unicorn? I can't find any nails!
  A. There are no nails to be found. Use the red-hot spikes instead.
  B. There aren't any red-hot spikes, either.
  C. You don't need to shoe the unicorn.

I can't reach the saddle!
  A. There are two ways to get the saddle. Both require Magick.
  B. One way is to obtain a Wand of Levitation. If you find the wand, POINT
     IT AT THE SADDLE. Then PICK UP THE SADDLE.
  C. The other way is more violent (and fun).
  D. It involves the amulet.
  E. PUT ON THE AMULET and speak its Word of Power. Your increased strength
     will allow you to BREAK DOWN THE STALL. Then you can GO INTO THE STALL
     and PICK UP THE SADDLE.

That unicorn sure looks sad. Isn't there anything I can do for her?
  A. She probably doesn't enjoy being cooped up like that.
  B. There are three (count 'em, three!) ways to free the unicorn. All
     require the use of Magick.
  C. The first two solutions are the same ones you can use to obtain the
     saddle. Refer to the previous question for clues.

  A. You need a lure.
  B. Insects are attracted to sweet things.
  C. You'll find something sweet on the Ethereal Plane of Atrii.
  D. There's a sweet, sticky coating inside the goblet.
  E. Just bring the goblet to the butterfly's vicinity and WAIT. It won't
     take long for her to find the sweet coating.

Is there any way to get a scarecrow?
  A. No. You don't need to move any scarecrows to complete the story.

What do I do with the scarecrows?
  A. EXAMINE each one of them.
  B. One of the scarecrows is not like the others.

Gurth
*****

The street hawker dropped something!
  A. Oh, well. She's gone now.
  B. PICK UP THE FISH CAKE. Quickly!

This old woman looks awfully familiar.
  A. She may indeed, if you've visited another store previously.

Is there anything I need to buy in the Magick Shoppe?
  A. Many of the items are quite useful. One is essential.
  B. Unfortunately, it's the most expensive item. The hourglass.
  C. It's impossible to afford the hourglass unless you find something
     incredibly valuable to trade for it.
  D. Such a treasure lies in the jungles of Miznia.
  E. Take a ride on the Skyway and pay attention to the conductor.
  F. You must retrieve the Crocodile's Tear. When you do, SELL THE TEAR TO
     THE OLD WOMAN. Now you can afford the hourglass.

Can I do anything at the Shady Wall?
  A. You bet.
  B. But only if you have a gray sphere. Refer to the appropriate question
     for details.


The Jungles of Miznia
*********************

How do I get into the gondola?
  A. Just GET INTO THE GONDOLA.
  B. It helps if you wait for the conductor to say "All aboard."

Are the support towers good for anything?
  A. Of course. They hold up the gondola. They're also a convenient way to
     visit the jungle.
  B. Read the room description carefully as you pass one of the towers.
  C. There's a maintenance platform near the top of each tower.
  D. JUMP ONTO THE PLATFORM as your gondola passes by one of the towers. Now
     you can CLIMB DOWN A LADDER and visit the jungle.

What can I do with the mossy rock?
  A. The question is, what will the mossy rock do with you?
  B. It's not really a mossy rock. It's a bloodworm!
  C. It's clobberin' time!

It's completely dark! What happened?
  A. Looks like you've fallen into the idol. Hope you brought your lantern.

Is there any light source besides the lantern?
  A. Yes. One magic item produces a very brief glow of light.
  B. It's the amulet.
  C. PUT ON THE AMULET and speak its Word of Power. The glowing star will
     provide two moves' worth of illumination.

Is there anything to do inside the idol?
  A. Reread the room description.
  B. Read The Lore and Legends of Quendor.
  C. The moss on the walls should look familiar.
  D. It's Moss of Mareilon. Use it to boost your dexterity. It can't hurt.

Why can't I see the secret door in the idol?
  A. It's an awfully good secret.
  B. So secret that it doesn't even exist.
  C. Sorry. There is no secret door.

How do I get back outside of the idol?
  A. There are no less than four ways to escape from the idol. All of them
     involve Magick.
  B. One of the ways involves a wand.
  C. The Wand of Eversion will do the trick.
  D. "Eversion" means "inside out."
  E. POINT THE WAND OF EVERSION AT THE IDOL. You're free!
  F. The other three ways are the same as getting out of the cellar. Just
     develop the last three clues pertaining to escaping from the Cellar.

I can see the Crocodile's Tear, but I can't reach it without falling into
the idol! This is driving me crazy!
  A. The idol's maw is like a seesaw.
  B. You need something heavier than you to hold down the bottom end.
  C. One of your jungle friends may be able to help.
  D. How about the mother hungus?
  E. You have to get the mother hungus to follow you.
  F. Read The Lore and Legends of Quendor.
  G. If you threaten the baby hungus, his mother will chase you through the
     jungle!
  H. The hungus is slow. Give her time to catch up. If you're wearing the
     cloak, take it off... it makes it harder for her to follow you.
  I. Lead the mother hungus to the idol. GET INTO THE MAW. The mother will
     climb up onto the bottom edge. Now you can climb up and GET THE JEWEL.
  J. Sort of.

I lost the jewel! How do I get it back?
  A. A great, big bottle of laxative might work.
  B. Unfortunately, there's no laxative to be found. Try something else.
  C. There's a wand that can help.
  D. It's the Wand of Eversion.
  E. "Eversion" means "inside out."
  F. POINT THE WAND OF EVERSION AT THE MOTHER HUNGUS.

Poor widdle baby hungus! Is there any way to rescue him?
  A. Yes. (Sniff.)
  B. To rescue the baby, you must obtain a Wand of Levitation. This can be
     tricky, as the wand's location varies from game to game.
  C. When you find the wand, POINT IT AT THE BABY HUNGUS.
  D. But don't free the baby before you get the Crocodile's Tear! Otherwise,
     you won't be able to complete the story.

What can I do at the waterfall?
  A. Nothing. It's just scenery.


Thriff
******

How do I stop the hunter from finding the minx?
  A. He might not find her if he didn't know where to look.
  B. He's following her footprints in the snow.
  C. Quick! RUB OUT THE FOOTPRINTS before the hunter arrives.

Where do I find chocolate truffles?
  A. Read The Lore and Legends of Quendor.
  B. They're not easy to find without help.
  C. One of the creatures in Lore and Legends can help you.

  E. PICK UP THE CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE before she eats it herself!
  F. And don't leave the truffle anywhere she can get her paws on it.

Those truffles don't last very long, do they?

  B. There is a way to keep truffles fresh.
  C. The clock setting on the hurdy-gurdy will renew the truffles when you
     turn the crank to the left (if the truffle is inside).

  F. Don't continue unless you've visited the forest north of Gurth.
  G. Have you answered the riddle on the boulder?
  H. Remember what the hollow voice says when you answer the riddle.
  I. DROP THE CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE INTO THE POOL. Or, WALK INTO THE POOL while
     holding a truffle. It will now remain fresh forever.

  A. Definitely. But only if you have a gray sphere. Refer to the
     appropriate question for details.

Is there anything I can do in the Chapel?
  A. Be quiet and pay attention.

  C. LOOK UNDER THE PEW. Surprise!

How do I get the reliquary?
  A. You have to earn it.
  B. Listen to the Cardinal's sermon. There may be an opportunity here.
  C. If you save Thriff from the Christmas tree monsters, "anything you ask
     will be your reward."
  D. Including the reliquary.
  E. After you thwart the Christmas tree monsters, find the Cardinal. ASK
     THE CARDINAL FOR THE RELIQUARY.

What is the glyph in the snowy clearing?
  A. Listen to Cardinal Toolbox in the chapel.
  B. It's a Glyph of Warding, left by Orkan. It prevents the Christmas tree
     monsters from entering the village.

The Christmas tree monsters won't let me past!
  A. They wouldn't be very good monsters if they did, would they?
  B. The Lore and Legends of Quendor is full of useful facts.
  C. You need a caterpillar. (See next question.)
  D. Once you've got a caterpillar, show it to the Christmas tree monsters.
     Then you'll be able to get by them.

Where do I find a caterpillar?
  A. Where do caterpillars come from?
  B. More precisely, what comes from caterpillars?
  C. Butterflies!
  D. You need to first get the butterfly from the Fields of Frotzen.
  E. Now you need to turn back the clock on the butterfly.

  G. PUT THE GOBLET (along with the butterfly) IN THE GURDY. CLOSE THE
     GURDY. TURN THE DIAL TO THE CLOCK. TURN THE CRANK TO THE LEFT. OPEN THE

  B. Read the little black book in the Laboratory.
  C. Did you LOOK UNDER THE DOME yet?
  D. Orkan cast a yonked girgol spell on the lava to keep it from erupting.

How do I stop the glyph from melting with the snow?
  A. You can't. You must find some other way to thwart the Christmas tree
     monsters.

How do I thwart the Christmas tree monsters?
  A. That Glyph of Warding seems to work just fine. But it's going to melt
     sooner or later. You must inscribe a more permanent Glyph.
  B. LOOK UNDER THE DOME at the Mountain Peak.
  C. You need to free that lava from Orkan's spell.
  D. There is a Magick item that neutralizes Magick.
  E. It's the Dispel Wand.
  F. POINT THE DISPEL WAND AT THE DOME.
  G. Run! The lava will bury you if you don't get out of its path!

I buried the Christmas trees, but they still trample the village!
  A. Obviously you didn't destroy all of the trees.
  B. The trees aren't the only things you destroyed in the Snowy Clearing.
  C. You also melted the Glyph of Warding.
  D. You need to inscribe another Glyph before the lava cools and the
     surviving trees trample the village.

I can't return to the clearing! It's too hot!
  A. If you wait for the lava to cool, then it's too late. You need Magick
     help to survive that heat.
  B. There is a Magick item that will help you resist heat.

I made it to the Lava Flow! Now what?
  A. The lava underfoot is still soft.
  B. It's an ideal drawing medium.
  C. INSCRIBE A GLYPH ON THE GROUND. When the lava cools, you'll have a
     Glyph of Warding permanently etched into the rock.

What tool do I need to inscribe a glyph?
  A. Read the black book from the Laboratory.
  B. Did you look inside the mailbox outside the Laboratory?
  C. Did you read the leaflet and open the parcel?
  D. You need the burin to inscribe a glyph. (As in _Spellbreaker_.)

Where can I study glyphs? I don't know which one to inscribe!
  A. There's one you can study in the Snowy Clearing.
  B. There's another one in the little black book.

     Rock Wall (northwest of Thriff), repeat the Word of Power uttered by
     the warlock you saw in the vision.

     Magick.

Underground
***********

How do I see underground? It's dark.
