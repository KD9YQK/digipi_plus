Note:

This version of Cutthroats was ripped from a C64 disk image.  I have not played
it all the way through, but I do have every confidence that it is the whole file,
and is not missing parts or having extra parts.  I have sample source code for a
tool that will rip a dat from D64 files, but it will only work with about half
of the games, and you have to change the code itself to select the extraction
method.  It is distributed in ANSI C source with the occasional 'new'.  This is
so people don't randomly rip games and release bad rips.  Contact me for the
source.  (C64 disks contain a loader you can 'see' on the disk, and the loader
gets the data directly from the disk, not from a file listed in the file system).
