           Cutthroats             Part I

 Welcome aboard, matey! Dust off your scuba tank, shake out your
flippers, and prepare to go treasure hunting. But first, a word
from our sponsor. Cutthroats, like most Infocom games, has
several solutions. This walkthru will show you one way of
completing the adventure. However, there are others, so when
you've finished, you might want re-play the game, doing 
different things, to see if you can come up with another way of
recovering the treasures successfully. 

Also, you should be aware that you can only recover treasures
from 2 of the ships, the Sao Vera and the S.S. Leviathan. The
other wrecks are only red herrings, and you don't have to bother
with them. Which of the two real wrecks you will dive for depends
on the item you are shown by Johnny Red. If he shows you the gold
coin, it's the Sao Vera; if it's the dinner plate, then the ship
is the Leviathan. 

Further, most of your actions up to the dive itself will be
pretty much the same, so this section of the walkthru will take
you up almost to the dive itself. After that, consult either the
Sao Vera section, or the Leviathan section, depending on which
ship you're investigating. 

Ok! The game starts with a long lead in, explaining how you came
by the book of shipwrecks. You will have to sit through this on
each boot-up; no way around it. After that, the game really
begins, with you lying in bed in your scruffy room at the Red
Boar Inn. The first thing to do is stand up, then wind your watch
(time is important in the game, and if your watch runs  down, you
can't keep track of the time). 

There's a note on the floor. Read that, then open your dresser.
Inside are the shipwreck book, your bankbook, and a room key. Get
the key, open the door, go out, and lock the door again. You
don't want to leave the door open, or the Weasel will come by
later and steal the shipwreck book. If that happens, the game is
over before it even starts. You don't need to take the book with
you, so locking the door is effective here. 

Now, go downstairs and out to the Wharf Road. Follow the road
East until you get to the Shanty. Enter the Shanty, and you will
see Johnny Red and Pete the Rat already there. Sit down and order
breakfast, then wait for Weasel to show. Order a glass of water
when you get thirsty. While you're waiting, you might want to
listen to the parrot. He doesn't have anything important to say,
but you might get a chuckle out of him. 

Eventually, Weasel will arrive, and Johnny will ask if you're
interested in doing some treasure hunting. Say yes, and then
Johnny will have you all meet again a little later at the
lighthouse, in order to keep McGinty from finding out what you're
up to. After that, leave the Shanty, go back West to the end of
Wharf Road, and from there Southwest twice and Northwest once,
which brings you to the lighthouse. Now, wait for Pete, who will
be the last person to arrive. 

Once Pete gets there, Johnny will show an object, either the coin
or the plate. This indicates which wreck to dive for. After that,
he'll give further instructions, which you should read carefully.
When he's finished, go back to your room at the Red Boar. Get
your passbook. If you're diving for the Leviathan, also get your
scuba gear from the closet (scuba gear not needed for the Sao
Vera). 

Leave the room (lock the door behind you!), and go back out. Walk
East along Wharf road to the end, and go Southeast to the Ocean
Road. If you're going to use your scuba gear for the dive, go
Southwest into the alley, and drop your scuba gear there. You
don't want McGinty to see you lugging it around. 

Follow the Ocean Road south to the end, then go Southwest to the
Ocean Road, and North into the bank. Make your withdrawl, then
leave and return to Ocean Road, where you go Southeast to Point
Lookout. Drop your passbook here (that Mcginty has sharp eyes,
and you don't want him to see you with that, either), and wait
for Johnny. 

When Johnny arrives, show him the money you just took from the
bank. He'll be satisfied, and then ask if the wreck is more than
200 feet underwater. Answer yes if it's the Sao Vera, no if it's
the Leviathan. The two of you will then head back to
International Outfitters to rent a ship and purchase supplies and
equipment. McGinty will be in the store when you get there. 
However, just wait, and he'll leave eventually. 

Johnny will make his purchases first, and you will have to chip
in some of the cash you're carrying. However, you will have
plenty of money left over to buy whatever you need. When it's
your turn, buy the flashlight and the shark repellent. If you're
diving for the Sao Vera, that's all you need. However, if you are
diving for the Leviathan, also buy the following items: C
battery, putty, and electromagnet, and also rent the small air
compresser (so you can fill your tank). All these items will be
delivered to the ship for you, so you don't have to take them
with you. 

Now, it's time to uncover a little double-dealing. Leave
Outfitters, and go back East along Wharf Road to the end, then
Southeast again to Ocean Road. Go along Ocean Road to the end,
then Southwest to Shore Road, and continue West along Shore Road
until you reach the Ferry dock. Wait around. 

Soon McGinty will appear, and a short while later, Weasel. The
two men will go off to a corner and talk. Then Weasel will hand
something to McGinty, and board the Ferry (you can't get on it
yourself, but you have other things to do, anyway). Ok, now
you've seen that, go back to Ocean Road, and then into the
alleyway. 

The alley runs behind all the buildings, and it will come in very
handy! Go West along the alley (pick up your scuba gear if you
dropped it here earlier) , until you're standing behind the
vacant lot, which is next door to McGinty's. Wait here, and
McGinty will come by, heading from East to West. Continue
waiting, and he will soon re-appear, going from West to East (he
is walking along Wharf Road, of course). 

Once you see him the second time, go West once, and you're behind
his store. The door is locked, but you can open the window and
get through into the place. Here you will find an envelope that
proves the Weasel is out to double-cross you all. Get the
envelope, then leave by the window. 

Go back along the alley to the Vacant lot, then go straight North
until you come to the dock where the rental ships are moored.
Both ships have approximately the same layout; they are slightly
different on the top deck, but below they are exactly the same.
Enter whichever ship has been rented for the dive, and go below
deck. Then go north until you reach the crews quarters, and hide
your envelope under the bed. You don't want Weasel to know you
have it (he'll kill you), and if you show it to Johnny now,
you'll cancel the expedition. 

Now you have to do some more waiting. The delivery boy will come
around, and drop off the items you've bought. Then the others
will start to arrive. When Johnny comes, go to the Captain's
Cabin, and tell him the longitude and latitude of the wreck,
which you can easily get by looking at the shipwreck book that
came in the game package. Then go back to the crews quarters, and 
wait some more. Eventually, you'll reach the dive site. At this
point, you should now read either the Sao Vera section or the
Leviathan section, whichever is applicable. 


           Cutthroats             Part II - Leviathan

 Ok, so it's time for the Leviathan. Get up, then go North to the
storage locker. Here you will find all the things you bought at
Outfitters. Put on your wet suit and flippers. Get the drill and
the C battery, open the drill, put the battery inside, and close
the drill. Get the remaining items, except the compresser. Fill
your tank with the compresser, then go South. Along the way, get
the envelope from under the bed. 

Stop in the galley to eat and drink, then continue on South to
the Captain's Quarters. Show Johnny the envelope. That will take
care of Weasel! Now go North and up. Put on your tank and mask.
Johnny will tell you about the orange line, but for this dive, it
won't be needed. 

You're all set, so dive in! Once underwater, turn on your
flashlight, because it's going to get dark pretty soon. Oops! A
shark just showed up! Good thing you have the repellent. Open the
canister, and the shark will take off. Now, just keep going down
until you reach the wreck. 

You're on the top deck of the Leviathan, with a hole at your
feet. Go down through the hole, to the Middle Deck. Here, you can
only go up or down, so go down again, to the Below Decks area.
From there, go South, to the room with the closed door. You might
want to read the sign on the door before you open it. 

Once past the door, you're in a mine locker. All the mines are
tied down, except for one loose one, floating in front of a hole.
Fortunately, you can take care of that problem without
difficulty. Touch the magnet to the mine, then turn on the
magnet. Drop the magnet (why that doesn't blow you to bits, I
don't know, but that's how it works). Now you can go up through
the hole. 

You're on the Middle Deck again, although a different part of it.
The way South is narrow, so remove your tank, then go due South
until you come to the room with the safe. This is the tricky
part. Turn on the drill, drill the lock, and then *immediately*
turn off the drill again. Otherwise, it will burn out, and you'll
have a big problem later! 

Ok, inside the safe is a glass case containing some valuable
stamps. Alas, there is a crack in the case, and water is starting
to seep in. However, don't be alarmed; you'll have enough time to
fix that. Go back North to the room with the hole in it. Put your
tank back on. Go through the hole into the mine locker, then
North, then up through another hole. 

Surprise! This room still has air in it. Good thing, too, because
the water level in the case was starting to get too high for
comfort! Now, turn on the drill, and drill a hole in the case. As
the water drains out, the drill dies (lasted just long enough).
Now, open the tube of putty, and put the glob of putty on the
hole. The putty will seal both the hole and the crack. 

And that's just about it for the Leviathan. All you have to do
now is go back through the ship, and up to your own boat, where
your comrades are waiting. Congratulations! You're now a very
rich diver! 


           Cutthroats             Part III - Sao Vera

 So, it's off to the Sao Vera. This one has a few more obstacles
than the Leviathan did, but none of them are particularly
difficult. The first thing is to get off the bed, and head North
to the Storage Locker. Here you'll find the flashlight and
repellent, as well as a deap-sea diving outfit. There is also a
small machine here, that you won't be needing (it's a locater
box. If you really want to fiddle with it, you have to buy a dry 
cell to make it work). 

Get everything but the box, then go back South. Get the envelope
from under your bed, stop off in the Galley to eat and drink,
then continue on to Johnny's cabin. Show him the envelope, which
will put an end to Weasel's double-cross. Now wear the suit and
go up on deck. 

Johnny will be there, and will tell you about the orange line.
Keep in mind what he says. If you look around, you'll see a large
air compressor, with an air hose. Attach that to your suit, and
then turn on the compressor. You're all set, so dive in! 

Once underwater, turn on your flashlight. There's that pesky
shark again! Open your canister to get rid of it, then keep on
going down. It will be a long way down, but you'll get there. 

Now you're on the top deck of the Sao Vera, with a hole at your
feet. Go down the hole. Crash! Looks like the ladder broke. You
may have a problem getting back up again! Then again, maybe not.
Leave that for now, and make your way South, into the room with
the iron bars. Get one, because it will come in handy soon. 

Then keep going South, until you come to the room with the bunks
barring the way. Move the bunks with the bar, then wedge the bar
under the bunks to keep them from moving back. Now you can go
South again, to another room, with a ladder leading down. Climb
down that one. 

Oops! Crash again! This time, though, the whole ladder didn't
crumble. Still, it's going to be hard to reach it on your way
back. No matter, you still have to find tha treasure, so go
North. 

Uh Oh!! There's a giant squid here! Good thing for you it's
asleep. And if you're smart, you won't wake it up! So, just go
right on by, don't try doing anything to the squid at all. In the
next room is an oak chest, along with a hole in the side of the
ship. Leave that for now, and keep going North. 

In the next room are some skeletons, remains of the crew. Examine
them, and you'll see one wears a scabbard. In the scabbard is a
sword. Get that, and go North again, to the last room. Here you
will find a maple chest. The chest is to heavy to carry, so push
it back South until you come to the oak chest (note: you must say
"Push Maple Chest South"). 

Hmmmm, now, which chest to take? Let's try the oak chest. Push
that out West through the hole (carefully! You don't want to cut
your air supply!). Wait awhile, and the orange line will appear.
Get that, tie it to the oak chest, and tug on the line. The chest
will slowly make its way upward, while you return to the ship. 

Now, push the maple chest south, past the sleeping squid, and
south again into the room with the ladder. Climb on the chest,
and you'll be able to reach the ladder and climb back up to the
middle deck. 

>From there, go North until you reach the room with the cask in
it. Now, push the cask north with you, until you come back to the
room with the mast and the rope tied around it. Climb on the
cask, then cut the rope with the sword. Drop the sword (you can't
leave with it), and then make your way up and out. 

Once on the top deck, just keep going up until you're back on the
boat. The chest will be opened to display hundreds of gold coins.
Congratulations, you're now a very rich diver!
